"template":  "One very nice morning near the end of summer,\nmy mother woke me up at 4:00 A.M. and said, \"Wake\nup and smell the grass, sleepy head! Today is your\nfirst day of school and you can't be late.\" I groaned in\nmy bed for twenty seconds, but eventually I got\ndressed. I wore a blue and white striped, long sleeve\n{} with a collar on it, a red tie,\ndark gray pants, white socks, black shoes, and a(n)\n{} hat. In ten minutes I made\nlunch and ate my breakfast. {}\nminutes later, the bus came. A few minutes later, I\nwas at school.\nIn school, I met two really\n{} kids. All of us became\nfriends very fast. That day we had Science, and\nluckily my friends and I were at the same\n{} .My friends' names are\n{} and\n{}. In Math we weren't\ntogether, and that really bugged me. We learned what\n{} were, and when to use\nthem. At snack and recess, we played a game\ntogether. It was extremely fun. At P. E., we were\n{} off of the ropes onto\n{}. I thought it was a very\n{} idea. In swimming class,\nwe needed to swim extremely\n{}, or else we would have to\nswim longer.\nBefore I knew it, school was over. I grabbed all\nmy belongings and put them into my backpack. In two\nminutes, the bus came. As I stepped into the bus I\nshouted, \"Goodbye, adios amigos, and shalom,\" to\nmy friends. Then I went into the bus. In a flash, I was\nback home. This day was an extremely exciting day!"}
